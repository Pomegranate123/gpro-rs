# gpro-rs

Gpro is a command-line program which displays guitar-pro files. It was made to be a linux alternative to [Songbook](https://www.linkesoft.com/songbook/).

# Features

- Display guitar-pro files
- Customizable theme
- Navigate folders and open files with a directory tree

# Installation

Currently the only way to use gpro is cloning the repo and building it with `cargo build --release` using the rust-nightly toolchain. Other install methods may be added later.
